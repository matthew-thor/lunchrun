# Lunch Run

Lunch Run is a labor of love made and maintained by [Matthew Thor](https://github.com/matthew-thor) to help schedule group activities. Originally made for a group of runners who meet in Chicago's Loop, Lunch Run will be expanded to support other activities and multiple groups.

## Tech stack

Lunch Run is built primarily on a **NERD** stack (**N**ode, **E**xpress, **R**eact, **D**atabase -- Postgres in this case) while also relying heavily on GraphQL (Apollo).
